# setTimeout and setInterval

These two functions are not by default given to us by JS.

Q. Then how are we able to use it?

1. setTimeout: It is a function that helps to execute some task after a certain timer.

2. setInterval: It is a function that helps us to execute some task again & again after a given interval.

# Callbacks

A callback is a function that is passed to another function.

    f(g(x))  // g(x) is a function in f().

**callback image**

# arr.map(fn)  

**fn is a callback function**

for all the elements of the given array, it passes the elements as an argument to the callback.
